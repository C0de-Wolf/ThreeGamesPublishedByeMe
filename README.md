# ThreeGamesPublishedByeMe
These are the three games I published. Unfortunately, I deleted the files and have no longer the codes: https://wolfm1nd.itch.io/ 

Top down shooter was my first game. Since than I created a lot of games, most unpublished.
Adam's Apple is a game created for a gamejam. It took my team (3 people- I was the programmer) 2 days to finish the game.
Hahahhahaa is a challange I did. I completed that game in under an hour. Later, I experimented with Post Processing.
